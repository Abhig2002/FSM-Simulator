# Finite State Machine Simulator

Welcome to the Finite State Machine (FSM) Simulator! This Java program allows you to define a finite state machine, set up transitions between states, and simulate the behavior of the machine based on user inputs.

## Introduction
Finite State Machines are computational models used to describe dynamic behavior in various applications, including software engineering, natural language processing, and more. This FSM Simulator provides a simple yet powerful tool to define states, transitions, and simulate the behavior of a finite state machine.

## Features
- Define states for the finite state machine.
- Specify transitions between states along with the inputs to trigger those transitions.
- Simulate the behavior of the finite state machine based on user inputs.
- Easy-to-use command-line interface.

## Usage
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Compile the Java Files:**
   ```
   javac FiniteStateMachineSimulator.java Machine.java State.java
   ```

3. **Run the Program:**
   ```
   java FiniteStateMachineSimulator
   ```

4. **Follow On-Screen Instructions:**
   - Enter the state names for the finite state machine.
   - Specify transitions between states and inputs to invoke them.
   - Provide inputs to simulate the machine.
   - Type "exit" to end the simulation.

## Classes Overview
- **`FiniteStateMachineSimulator`:** Main class responsible for user interaction, initialization, and simulation.
- **`Machine`:** Represents the finite state machine, handles state transitions, and maintains the current active state.
- **`State`:** Represents a state in the finite state machine, contains information about state name, type (start/finish), and adjacent states.
